/**
 * Pattern: <b>Orchestrator-workers</b>
 * <p/>
 * In this pattern, a central LLM (the orchestrator) dynamically breaks down
 * complex tasks into subtasks,
 * delegates them to worker LLMs, and uses a synthesizer to combine their
 * results. The orchestrator analyzes
 * the input to determine what subtasks are needed and how they should be
 * executed, while the workers focus
 * on their specific assigned tasks. Finally, the synthesizer integrates the
 * workers' outputs into a cohesive result.
 * <p/>
 * Key components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Orchestrator: Central LLM that analyzes tasks and determines required
 * subtasks</li>
 * <li>Workers: Specialized LLMs that execute specific subtasks</li>
 * <li>Synthesizer: Component that combines worker outputs into final
 * result</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * When to use: This pattern is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't
 * predict the subtasks needed upfront.
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Coding tasks where the number of files to change and nature of changes
 * depend on the specific request</li>
 * <li>Search tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from
 * multiple sources</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * While topographically similar to parallelization, the key difference is its
 * flexibility—subtasks aren't
 * pre-defined, but dynamically determined by the orchestrator based on the
 * specific input. This makes it
 * particularly effective for tasks that require adaptive problem-solving and
 * coordination between multiple
 * specialized components.
